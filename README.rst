PySecretHandshake - Secret Handshake in Python
==============================================


This module implements Secret Handshake as specified in Dominc Tarr's paper `"Designing a Secret Handshake:
Authenticated Key Exchange as a Capability System" <http://dominictarr.github.io/secret-handshake-paper/shs.pdf>`_
(Dominic Tarr, 2015).

**Please, don't use this package in production. The implementation hasn't yet been carefully checked.**
